# Hey there, I'm Sayonika! 👋

## A sneak peek at projects I've worked on!

### Catalog Indexing Engine
- This project employs microservices based architecture and supports both structured and unstructured queries to retrive information from huge volumes of fashion catalogs, displaying the most relevant products to end users, with the aid of Large Language Models (LLMs)

### StoryTube
- This project generates a rough 2D animation from short-story text to make narrative content easier to understand and to help creators quickly visualize story ideas. The system takes an English story as input, preprocesses it, and extracts key information such as characters, actions, and dialogues. Dialogues are mapped to their respective subjects, and this structured output is passed to a PyGame-based animation module. The final result is a simple, automatically generated 2D visualization of the story in video form with the background, character dialogues and animations.

### Custom Shell
- A custom Unix shell implemented in C with full support for process creation, pipelines, and shell state management. The shell uses fork(), execv(), waitpid(), and pipe() to execute commands and enable concurrent inter-process communication. It also includes built-in commands such as cd, path, alias, and history, with alias-aware validation before pipeline execution. All memory is fully managed and verified leak-free using Valgrind.
